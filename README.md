# Data-Flywheel
The data flywheel turns raw data into a durable competitive advantage. Over time, it transforms operational efficiency, customer experience, and revenue growth

The data flywheel is a strategic concept where the continuous generation and use of data creates a self-reinforcing cycle â€” more data leads to better insights, which leads to better services, which in turn generates more data. In telecom-scale, petabyte-level data-intensive applications, this flywheel becomes a powerful source of competitive advantage and business value.
